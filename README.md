# New Tab Thing 

## How

 - clone this repo
   - for examples sake, let's say it's cloned in `~/workspace/new-tab-thing`
 - go to `chrome://extensions/` (it only works in chrome)
 - enable developer mode in the top right 
 - select `load unpacked`
 - select the `~/workspace/new-tab-thing` folder
 - open a new tab, should be replaced with this extension

## Customizing
 
 - just edit any of these files and reload the new tab page
   - e.g. if you want to edit the links, edit `index.html`
 - there's no third party js or css, so there's nothing to compile.
 - it's using css variables to set the color scheme, so you'll have to look up the syntax for that if you're unfamiliar
